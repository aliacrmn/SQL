-- In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.


-- 1) How many orders were placed in January? 

SELECT count(*)
FROM JanSales

-- 2) How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT count (*)
FROM JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND Product LIKE "iPhone";


-- 3) Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM customers
INNER JOIN FebSales
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(orderID) = 6;


-- 4) Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT Product, MIN(price)
FROM JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6;


-- 5) What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
-- (Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products).
SELECT product, SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY Product;


-- 6) Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT sum(Quantity), product, sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM FebSales 
WHERE location = "548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101"
GROUP BY product;


-- 7) How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(distinct customers.acctnum), AVG(quantity*price) AS avg_amount_spent
FROM FebSales
LEFT JOIN customers
ON FebSales.orderID = customers.order_id
WHERE FebSales.Quantity > 2
AND length(orderID) = 6;


-- 8) List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity)
FROM FebSales
WHERE location LIKE "%Los Angeles%"
GROUP BY Product


-- 9) Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive?
SELECT distinct location, count(orderID)

--(Hint: just like question 3, we want the overall average, not the average for each account individually).
SELECT sum(quantity)/count(customers.acctnum)
FROM FebSales
LEFT JOIN customers
ON FebSales.orderID = customers.order_id
WHERE length(orderID) = 6;

-- 13) Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?
